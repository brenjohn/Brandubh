# Brandubh
This repository has python code for playing a game called Brandubh and to use various reinforcement learning methods to train a bot to play against. Running the play_brandubh script should start the game.

Brandubh is an Irish variation of the ancient board game known as Hnefatafl. The original rules of the game are unknown but a reconstruction of the rules based on boards found in Ireland and Irish poems detailing the game are discribed at the following link:

The game implemented here currently uses a simplified version of these rules which are described in the rulebook contained in the game and will eventually be updated to include rules from the above link that have been ommited.
